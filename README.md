# Flatiron::SpaceX::CLI

Thank you for trying the Space-X Launch CLI! This Command Line Interface allows the user to find location, and flight information regarding every launch done by SpaceX.
Typing exit at any point while running the program will end the program, and typing main will return to the main selection area.
This cli was created using the Unofficial SpaceX API found at https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches.

To start the CLI, please type bin/run
